    "The **probability** of an outcome is a number between 0 and 1 that indicates how often that outcome should be observed when we perform the experiment. In our two examples (Coin Toss and Die Roll), each outcome has the same probability, but that is not true for every experiment. \n",

A non-numeric analogue of a random variable is a **random quantity** (source: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/236765/does-a-random-variable-needs-to-be-numeric). An example of a random quantity is the UV index on a given day, which can take on values of low, moderate, high, and very high. Many random quantities can represented with random variables by mapping the outcomes to real numbers (i.e. replace low, moderate, high, very high with 0, 1, 2, 3).\n"
