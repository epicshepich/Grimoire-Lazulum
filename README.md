# Grimoire Lazulum
The Grimoire Lazulum is a repository of the miscellaneous scripts that I have written that are too small to be their own standalone project but are sometimes handy in a variety of contexts (and are sometimes not really handy at all). This project was formerly named JSSAR (Jim Shepich's Swiss Army Repository).
